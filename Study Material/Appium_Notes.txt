 	What is Authentication in an API?
	Authentication simply means “proving who you are” before you’re allowed to access something.
	When two systems communicate through an API, the receiving system wants to make sure:
	“Is this request really coming from someone who’s allowed to do this?”
	That process — of checking identity — is called Authentication.


Real-life analogy:
	Imagine you’re trying to enter a secure office building.
	At the front desk:
	The guard asks for your ID card (to verify who you are).
	If your name is on the approved list, you’re allowed in.
	If not, access is denied.
	That’s authentication — proving your identity before entry.
	In APIs, it works the same way:
	The system checks your “digital ID” before letting you use its data or services.

 Then starts explaining what is Mobile testing.
 
 What is Mobile testing ?
Mobile testing refers to test the mobile application (apps - facebook,icici, amazon, flipkart) on various devices (android devices, IOS devices) and platform android and iOS to ensure functionality working as expected to provide smooth and bug free experience (USER).


Testing Conduct on mobile
   1. Functional
   2. Usability | compatibility
   3. Accessibility
   4. Performance
   5. Security
   6. Configuration  | Interupts testing
   7. Hardware testing.


   Types of mobile testing
   1. Manually
   2. Automation.


1. Type of Application
   a. Native apps
   b. Mobile WebApps
   c. Hybrid Application
   d. Progressive Web Apps (PWAs)


Native apps
	What: Built specifically for one platform (iPhone/iPad = iOS, or Android).
	Good for: Best speed, looks, and access to phone features (camera, GPS).
	Downside: Need to build two versions if you want iOS + Android.

Web apps
	What: A website that works on your phone (runs inside the browser).
	Good for: Works everywhere instantly — no download.
	Downside: Limited access to device features and offline use.

Hybrid apps
	What: Web apps wrapped inside a native container so they can be installed like an app.
	Analogy: A web store put inside a mall kiosk — easier to deploy, but not as polished as a custom shop.
	Good for: Faster to build for multiple platforms.
	Downside: Can be slower or less “native” feeling.
	
	Developers build the app with web languages (HTML, CSS, JavaScript) — the same tools used to build websites.

	That web code is then wrapped by a small native program (the shell) so the app can be installed on phones.


Progressive Web Apps (PWAs)
	What: Advanced web apps that can be installed to the home screen and work offline.
	Analogy: A website that behaves like a light-weight app.
	Good for: No app-store upload, fast to update, reaches everyone.
	Downside: Still limited access to some phone features on some devices.

Cross-platform (React Native, Flutter, etc.)
	What: One codebase that builds native-like apps for iOS and Android.
	Analogy: A tailored suit pattern that can be adjusted to fit two people well.
	Good for: Good balance of speed, look, and development cost.
	Downside: Some platform-specific features can be trickier.	


How to create project in android studio
1. Click on newProject
2. Select empty Activity
3. Click on finish with default setting to create project
4. once project created, on right side 3rd option > click on device manager
5. Click on play button next to vitural type
6. configure envronment variable of android studio
	a. go to drive C
	b. user folder (login)
	c. App data (if not visible that means folder is hidden, check show > hidden items option under view to visible)
	d. local > android > sdk (copy this path) paste in Notepad.
	e. go to this PC > right click on it 
	f. click on show more options
	g. click on properties
	h. go to Advanced system setting > Environment variable 
	i. Create system variable - ANDROID_HOME and set the path
	J. look for path variable > Edit it
	k. configure new below variables
			1. %ANDROID_HOME%\platform-tools
			2. %ANDROID_HOME%\tools
			3. %ANDROID_HOME%\tools\bin 
	l.save it and go to sdk folder > open cmd on this location
	m. adb devices

To get the UDID follow below steps (window laptop)
pre-condition of below steps
1. go to android studio or connect real devices in laptop or system
2. ensure devices or emulator up and running

Open terminal / cmd
1. go to sdk location of android and look for platform-tools folder
2. open that folder then click on address of the folder (click on top) then type cmd and hit enter
3. this will open cmd at same location.
4. adb devices in response return UDID of emulator or realdevices

2. start Appium server.
1. open cmd
2. appium


in appium version 1, we use desiredcapabilities clss to create device configuration.
